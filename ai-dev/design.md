Avoid defaulting to generic, "average" web design—this can lead to what's known as the "AI slop" look: bland, forgettable, and uninspired. Instead, aim for creative, memorable frontends that feel carefully crafted and visually striking.

Key Principles:

- Typography: Use beautiful, distinctive, and interesting fonts. Avoid generic choices like Arial, Inter, or Roboto. Select fonts that give the interface a unique personality and elevate its look.

- Color & Theme: Choose a cohesive, intentional color palette. Use CSS variables for consistency. Prefer strong, dominant colors with sharp accent colors; avoid pale, overly balanced color schemes. Look to IDE color themes or unique cultural references for inspiration.

- Motion: Add animations and micro-interactions thoughtfully. Favor smooth CSS-only animations in HTML, and use the Motion library in React if available. Prioritize impact: a single, well-choreographed animation (like a staggered page load) is more delightful than scattering small effects everywhere.

- Backgrounds: Go beyond solid backgrounds—bring in depth and atmosphere. Use layered CSS gradients, geometric or generative patterns, or subtle contextual effects that fit your design's theme.

What to avoid (signs of generic AI-generated design):

- Overused system font stacks (e.g. Inter, Arial, Roboto)
- Predictable color schemes, such as purple gradients on white
- Standard, uninspired layouts and common component patterns
- Designs lacking a sense of context or unique character

Be bold and creative! Don't settle for common choices (like Space Grotesk repeatedly). Switch between dark and light themes, experiment with fonts, and adapt aesthetics to the project at hand. The most important rule: think beyond the obvious and ordinary.
