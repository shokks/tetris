# Rule: Creating Effective Landing Pages

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in designing and implementing high-converting landing pages that prioritize clarity, simplicity, and user action. The landing page should communicate value within seconds and drive users toward a single clear goal.

## The Caveman Test

To quote Donald Miller: **"A caveman should be able to glance at your page and immediately grunt back what you offer."** In five seconds, customers try to establish whether or not you can help them. Make their life easy. Clarity over creativity.

## Above the Fold (Immediately Visible)

The top of your page earns attention. Follow this formula:

1. **Explain the value you provide** (title)
2. **Explain how you'll create it** (subtitle)
3. **Let the user visualize it** (visual)
4. **Make it believable** (social proof)
5. **Make taking the next step easy** (CTA)

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Keep Design Simple and Clean

The primary goal of a landing page during a launch is **clarity, not artistic flair**.

- **Remove Clutter**: Avoid complex navigation or excessive links that distract from your main message
- **Focus on the Value Prop**: Your landing page should clearly state what you do within the first few seconds of a user arriving
- **Limit Sections**: Hero, features (2-4 max), social proof (if available), and CTA - that's usually enough
- **Whitespace is Your Friend**: Don't cram content; let elements breathe

### 2. Write a Clear Title (Three Approaches)

The most common mistake is being too vague or using "marketing-speak."

**Approach 1: Explain What You Do**
When your product is unique, simply explain what you do as clearly as possible.
- "AI that answers questions about your portfolio"

**Approach 2: Use Hooks**
Most products aren't unique. A hook adds oomph by addressing your customer's biggest objection.

Formula: VALUE → OBJECTION → VALUE + HOOK
- "Rank higher on Google" + "I suck at SEO" → "You don't have to be an SEO pro to rank higher on Google"
- "Ace the SAT" + "I bet it's hard work" → "Ace the SAT with just 10 minutes of studying per day"
- "Track investments" + "I hate spreadsheets" → "Track investments without the spreadsheet headache"

**Approach 3: Own Your Niche**
Write with conviction. You're THE solution.
- "The portfolio assistant for retail investors"
- "Where investors get answers"

**The Mom Test**: Explain what your product does as if you were explaining it to your mother. If she wouldn't understand it, it's too complicated.

**Avoid Jargon**: Don't use buzzwords like "disruptive," "leveraging," "synergy," "revolutionary," or "cutting-edge." A high schooler should understand your value proposition.

**Good Examples:**
- "Get answers about your portfolio in seconds"
- "Chat with an AI that knows your investments"
- "Import your holdings, ask anything"

**Bad Examples:**
- "Revolutionizing the future of financial intelligence"
- "Synergizing AI-driven portfolio optimization paradigms"
- "Empowering your investment journey through innovation"

### 3. Write a Strong Subtitle

Subtitles are where you get specific. Introduce the product. Explain **how** it creates the value promised in your title.

- Title: "Your portfolio, explained"
- Subtitle: "Import your holdings, ask questions in plain English, get instant answers powered by AI."

### 4. Include a Strong Call to Action (CTA)

Don't leave the user wondering what to do next.

- **One Primary Goal**: Whether it's "Sign Up," "Get Early Access," "Start Free," or "Book a Demo," make it the most prominent element on the page
- **Minimize Friction**: Ask for the minimum amount of information necessary (e.g., just an email address) to get them into your funnel
- **Make it Obvious**: The CTA button should be visually distinct - larger, contrasting color, above the fold
- **Repeat the CTA**: Include it in the hero and again at the bottom of the page

**Three CTA Types (Beyond Basic "Sign Up"):**

1. **Call-to-Value**: Emphasize value over action. Fulfill the promise of your title.
   - "Get your portfolio insights" > "Sign up"
   - "Start tracking free" > "Create account"

2. **Objection Handler**: Add words to handle the user's biggest objection.
   
   Formula: CTA → OBJECTION → OBJECTION HANDLED
   - "Start Free!" + "I bet it asks for credit card" → "Start Free! No CC Required"
   - "Try Prisma" + "I don't have time" → "Try Prisma in 5 minutes"
   - "Get started" + "I bet this is expensive" → "Get started for just $1"

3. **Email Capture + CTA**: Pair email field with button to make signing up frictionless.
   - Skip the classic 10-field sign-up form
   - Just email + CTA button (like Netflix: "Ready to watch? Enter your email to start")
   - Collect more info during onboarding, not upfront

### 5. Show, Don't Just Tell

Visuals build trust and understanding faster than text. The goal is to get as close to reality as possible.

- **Use Visuals**: If you have a software product, show a screenshot or a short (5-10 second) gif of the product in action
- **Product Screenshots**: Show the actual interface, not abstract illustrations. Don't show fancy illustrations - show your product.
- **Social Proof (Above Fold)**: Adds instant credibility. Any startup can claim value - social proof makes you believe it.
  - Customer logos
  - Review count ("18,000+ reviews")
  - User count ("Trusted by 50,000 investors")
- **Don't Fake It**: If you're just starting, focus on the problem you're solving instead of fabricating testimonials
- **Avoid Stock Photos**: They feel generic and untrustworthy; use real product shots or custom graphics

### 6. Optimize for Mobile

Many people will click your launch links from Twitter, LinkedIn, or newsletters on their phones.

- **Mobile-First Testing**: Test the page on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
- **Fast Load Times**: Optimize images, minimize JavaScript, lazy load below-fold content
- **Tap-Friendly CTAs**: Buttons should be large enough to tap easily (min 44px height)
- **Readable Text**: Minimum 16px body font size on mobile
- **Stack Vertically**: Horizontal layouts should collapse to single column on mobile

### 7. Set Up Analytics Immediately

Before you launch, make sure you have tracking in place.

- **Basic Tracking**: Google Analytics, Vercel Analytics, or Mixpanel
- **Key Metrics**: Page views, bounce rate, time on page, CTA click-through rate
- **Traffic Sources**: Know where your visitors are coming from (UTM parameters)
- **Conversion Tracking**: Track sign-ups or form submissions as events

---

## Below the Fold (What Users Scroll To)

Above the fold earns attention. Below the fold earns the sale.

### 6. Features and Objections

Make concrete the value you promise above the fold.

- **Features that prove your promise**: If your title says "podcasts that look and sound amazing," your features should show exactly how (e.g., "Local recordings in 4K video quality," "Uncompressed crystal clear audio")
- **Handle objections**: Talk to customers. Group recurring objections. Use their own words to address them.
  - Customer says: "Is it simple?" → Feature: "So simple Grandma can use it"
  - Customer says: "Is setup easy?" → Feature: "Guests join with just one click"
  - Customer says: "I suck at tech" → Feature: "We built this for non-techies"
- Focus on 2-4 key features maximum

### 7. More Social Proof (Below Fold)

Above fold social proof = credibility. Below fold social proof = inspire action.

Use existing customers to bring to life the value you promise:
- "Get a smile you love" → Show real customers smiling (photos)
- "We've reinvented email" → Show real customers describing the difference (quotes)
- "How small brands sell more" → Show real sales numbers ("500,000+ businesses have generated $3.9+ billion in sales")

The formula: **Real customers + Real words + Real numbers**

Let customers sell for you - it's a free pass to sell your product.

### 8. FAQ Section

Features and objections that don't fit neatly above? Put them in FAQ.

- Write down common questions
- Reframe into Q&A format
- Tie up loose ends
- Can also handle objections: "What if it's not right for me?" → "No problem! Just send an email and we'll refund you, no questions asked."
- Can highlight selling points: "Can I expense this?" → "Yes! We've pre-written an email template to make it easier to ask your manager."

### 9. Second CTA

We've done the hard selling. Time for the 2nd CTA.

- You have the luxury of space now
- Instead of one button, remind them WHY they're clicking
- Structure: Happy users (avatars) + Reiterate value + Immediate results quote + CTA button
- Example: "Join hundreds of businesses who are doing more with email" + testimonial + "Add to Gmail with one click"

### 10. Founder's Note (Optional)

Leave the customer with a story that makes you easy to sum up. People buy from people.

Structure:
1. Put yourself in their shoes
2. Explain their problem
3. Take ownership of it
4. Show the happy ending

You're walking them down a path they'll want to walk themselves.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Content Anti-Patterns
- **Jargon-heavy headlines**: "Leveraging next-gen AI for portfolio synergy"
- **Vague value props**: "Better financial decisions start here"
- **Feature dumps**: Listing every feature without context
- **Multiple CTAs competing**: "Sign up," "Watch demo," "Read blog," "Join Discord"
- **Walls of text**: Long paragraphs that no one reads

### Design Anti-Patterns
- **Carousels/sliders**: Users rarely interact with them
- **Auto-playing videos with sound**: Instant bounce
- **Popup modals on load**: Destroys trust
- **Hamburger menu on desktop**: Hides important navigation
- **Generic stock photos**: "Business people shaking hands"
- **Parallax everything**: Distracting and often broken on mobile

### Technical Anti-Patterns
- **No mobile optimization**: 50%+ traffic is mobile
- **Slow load times**: Every second of delay loses conversions
- **No analytics**: Flying blind on what works
- **Broken form validation**: Users give up after one error

---

## Integration with Design System

When implementing, follow the guidelines in `design.md` for:

- **Typography**: Use distinctive, readable fonts that match brand personality
- **Color**: Ensure CTA button has maximum contrast against background
- **Motion**: Subtle animations on scroll or interaction, not overwhelming
- **Backgrounds**: Keep hero background simple to not compete with copy

---

## Process

1. **Define the Goal**: What single action should users take?
2. **Write Copy First**: Headline, subheadline, CTA text before any design
3. **Apply Caveman/Mom Test**: Read copy aloud - would a caveman grunt back what you do?
4. **Design Mobile First**: Start with 375px width, expand to desktop
5. **Add Visuals**: Product screenshots, not placeholders
6. **Test Load Speed**: Optimize images, check Lighthouse score
7. **Setup Analytics**: Track page views and CTA clicks
8. **Get Feedback**: Show to 3-5 people unfamiliar with your product
9. **Iterate**: Simplify anything that confuses testers

---

## The Sales Test

Your landing page is your sales pitch. Never forget this. Examine each element and ask:

> **"Would this help me sell if I met the customer in person?"**

If not, remove it. If you don't know, go out and sell to customers in person. You'll learn that fancy words and random images of people shaking hands don't get you far. More importantly, you'll learn the attitude of your customer and the words you need to convince them.

---

## Output

When creating a landing page:

- **Keep scope minimal**: Hero + Features + CTA is enough for launch
- **Use real content**: No Lorem Ipsum - write actual copy
- **Test on mobile first**: Most launch traffic comes from social links
- **Measure everything**: Can't improve what you don't track
- **Clarity over creativity**: A caveman should grunt back what you do
